### for Firebase add: package.json

## FIREBASE

I have commented the code that persists the data on firebase to protect my private credentials.
Therefore you can test the app easily because I mocked the data.

If you want to try it with firebase search for 'FIREBASE' at root folder and uncomment the code..
